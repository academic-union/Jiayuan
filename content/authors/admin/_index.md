## Self-evaluation 💜

I am a Taurus girl and my MBTI is INFP. I'm curious about things I haven't tried yet. In my daily life, I am friendly to others and hope to become good friends with everyone. In terms of study, I will continue to work hard for the goals I set and strive for the joy of achieving the goals. I am also full of enthusiasm and longing for the future. I believe that my current efforts can lay a good foundation for future life.
